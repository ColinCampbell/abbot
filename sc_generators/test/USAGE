test - Create a new unit test in your SproutCore client.

USAGE:

  ./script/generate test client_name/test_name [CLASS]
  
DISCUSSION:

This generator will create a new SproutCore unit test in your client.  You should pass as the first parameter your client directory name/the test you want to create.  For example:

./script/generate test todos/task

defines a new test called called "Task" in the file clients/todos/tests/task.rhtml.

The default test simply returns true.  Add your own tests to do something useful.
