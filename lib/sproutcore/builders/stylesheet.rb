  # This builder is used to process a single CSS stylesheet.  Converts any
  # build tool directives (such as sc_require() and sc_resource()) into
  # comments.  It will also substitute any calls to sc_static() (or
  # static_url())  This builder does NOT handle combining multiple stylesheets
  # into one.  See the Builder::CombineStylesheets builder instead.
